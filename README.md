Simple REST API providing backend functionalities for todo app from:  https://github.com/qunabu/junior-recruitment-task.

The app consists of node.js server deployed on Heroku (so it may take a moment to boot at the first interaction) and MongoDB database hosted on mLab. Its functionality is rather selfexplanatory.

If you want to test the app out it can be seen here: https://jamniczek.github.io/todo-app-front/
